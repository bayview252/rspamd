# rspamd
Custom local regex lua rules | ruleset for [rspamd](http://rspamd.com/).

Based on original work from https://git.ercpe.de/ercpe - rspamd and spamassassin
---


These rules are workarounds as I use a mail forwarder, thus can't utilise Postfix RBL/Rspamd SPF/DMARC for the majority of spam avoidance
